        <b>PMPML</b>
        <p> Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Ltd (PMPML, lit. Pune Metropolitan Transport Corporation), is the public
            transport bus service provider for the city of Pune (PMC & PCMC limits). Prior to its foundation on 19
            October 2007, the twin cities were served by two separate providers, viz. the Pune Municipal Transport (PMT)
            and the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Transport (PCMT). It operates 371 routes within a radius of 20 km around
            the two cities, including 51 Rainbow BRT routes that at least partially ply on the 4 bus rapid transit
            corridors.</p>
        <b>Early history</b>
        <p>Pune Nagarpalika, predecessor of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), conceived the idea of a public
            transport system for the city in the 1940s which materialized when the Regional Transport Office gave its
            nod for M/s. Silver Jubilee Motors to take up the charge. The service that began with 4 routes with 20 buses
            already had increased to 46 buses by 1948.</p>
        <b>PMT and PCMT</b>
        <p> After the transformation of Pune Nagarpalika into PMC in 1950, the civic body took over the service. Pune
            Municipal Transport (PMT), as it was named after the takeover, started with a fleet of 57 buses that plied
            on 14 routes.
            The public transport provider for the industrial city, Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Transport (PCMT), was
            founded on 4 March 1974 with a fleet of 8 buses plying between Pimpri and Bhosari. PCMT saw rapid expansion
            and already by 1988, it had a fleet of 101 buses plying on 13 routes.</p>
        <b>Merger</b>
        <p>A proposal for merger of PMT and PCMT into a unified company to serve the larger metropolitan regions was
            proposed as early as 1992, when the general body of the PMC passed a resolution supporting such merger.
            However, the PCMC only considered a merger in 2003.The merger was formally announced in April 2007 and PMPML
            as it exists today came into being on 19 October 2007.</p>
